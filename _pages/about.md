I'm an assistant professor for computer vision and machine learning at the [QUVA lab](https://ivi.fnwi.uva.nl/quva/) at the University of Amsterdam, where I work with [Cees Snoek](https://www.ceessnoek.info/), [Max Welling](https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/m.welling/) and [Efstratios Gavves](https://www.egavves.com/).
My PhD was at the [Visual Geometry Group (VGG)](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/) at the University of Oxford where I worked with [Andrea Vedaldi](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vedaldi/) and [Christian Rupprecht](https://chrirupp.github.io/). Prior to this I studied physics at the [University of Munich (LMU)](http://www.en.uni-muenchen.de/index.html) and [Economics in Hagen](https://www.fernuni-hagen.de/) as well as a [MSc in Mathematical Modelling and Scientific Computing](https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/members/students/postgraduate-courses/msc-mmsc) at the Mathematical Institute in Oxford. Also, I love running, the mountains ⛰️ and their combination.
