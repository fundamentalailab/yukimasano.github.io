I'll try to occasionally post some of the slides of my talks, in a way that there's not too much overlap.

### Birmingham 2024
At Univ. Birmingham Synergising the Human Brain and Arficial Neural Networks Workshop
* Why care about SSL, what is SSL
* TimeTuning: further tuning a DINO model with videos
* 1-video pretraining: better models than ImageNet from a single video
* 1-image distillation: achieving 69% top-1 on IN-1k with only 1-image as training inputs 
* [**Find the slides here**](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/cuv906b5lnszjgg12jgad/Birmingham.pdf?rlkey=3xrmoppxvxqd1kz1iayydj88m&dl=0)

### Barcelona 2024
At Apple Research
* PIN: PEFT method for vision-language models for object localisation
* Brief overview of PEFT methods
* VeRA: LoRA but 10-100x less parameters
* [**Find the slides here**](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/joxhicqp0w9i6njn5v7i6/Barcelona.pdf?rlkey=qibw6vcek1eupsq1jdavszw0d&dl=0)

### NeurIPS 2023
At Self-supervised Learning: Theory & Practice workshop
* Why care about SSL when we have CLIP?
* Why video SSL is sooo back
* TimeTuning: further tuning a DINO model with videos
* 1-video pretraining: better models than ImageNet from a single video
* Mimicking video-caption data with non-sense text and clustered images
